## Overview

This project analyzes the global impact of COVID-19 by merging multiple datasets to explore the relationships between economic, social, and health indicators and COVID-19 outcomes. Using advanced data visualization and exploratory data analysis (EDA), this study reveals insightful trends about how factors like GDP, life expectancy, and social support influence the pandemic's effects.

## Key Features

- **Merged multi-source datasets** to create a comprehensive view of COVID-19 impact worldwide.
- Performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to identify patterns in COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries across countries.
- Visualized correlations between **GDP, life expectancy, social support, and COVID-19 outcomes** using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- Generated impactful visualizations including **scatter plots and choropleth maps** to illustrate geographic and economic patterns.

## Key Insights

- Countries with higher happiness scores, strong GDP, and robust social support generally experienced **lower COVID-19 death rates**.
- A **negative correlation** between happiness and COVID-19 impact suggests happier nations might be better equipped to handle crises.
- Some exceptions exist, highlighting the need for further analysis into other contributing factors.
- Visualization techniques helped uncover both **geographic and socio-economic patterns** in COVID-19 data.
